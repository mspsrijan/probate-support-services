      <div class="services">
        <p>
          <strong><u>WHAT WE DO</u></strong> Our service is entirely on-line,
          all matters being dealt with by email.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide guidance and assistance on every aspect of non-contentious
          probate from recommendations on procedure to the settling or drafting
          of any document.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that, except in general terms, we do not deal with matters
          relating to the preparation of the HMRC account or the distribution of
          the estate. However, we can assist in the drafting of summonses for
          orders within the scope of the Non-Contentious Probate Rules and the
          preparation of the supporting evidence.

        <p>
          <strong><u>WHO WE ARE</u></strong> Initially the service was created
          in 2008 by Alan Dawson, retired District Probate Registrar at Leeds
          and Ian Sloan, retired senior Probate Officer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the sad demise of Alan, the expertise behind our services is
          currently provided by Roland D'Costa, retired District Probate
          Registrar at Oxford and now an editor of Tristram & Coote's Probate
          Practice.

          <strong><u> HOW MUCH DOES IT COST</u></strong> Our charging policy
          reflects our philosophy that we can provide answers to difficult
          problems more economically than the cost to a practitioner who has to
          spend valuable, and expensive, time on research.

          hours.
